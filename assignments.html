                <p>
                    Develop an interactive web application that implements a basic search engine using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). 
                    The search engine will take a user's query, perform LSA on a pool of documents, and return the top documents based 
                    on cosine similarity. he task involves applying LSA to reduce the dimensionality of the document-term matrix and 
                    using cosine similarity to measure the relevance of documents to the user's query.</p>

                <h3>Assignment 5: Predicting Customer Churn Using KNN</h3>
                <p>
                    Develop a predictive model to identify customers who are likely to churn (i.e., leave the bank) using the 
                    K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. Customer churn is a significant problem in the banking industry, as 
                    retaining customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. By accurately predicting which 
                    customers are likely to churn, banks can take proactive steps to improve customer retention.</p>

                <p>
                    Create an interactive webpage to demonstrate how modifying these parameters affects regression results, 
                    especially when there is no actual relationship between X and Y. By tweaking these settings, observe how 
                    randomness can influence the slope and intercept in a regression model.</p>
