            <h3>City of Chelsea Water Usage Analysis Report</h3>
            <p>This project focused on analyzing Chelsea`s water billing structures 
                to identify the key factors that influence charges, such as meter size and property type. 
                Through a detailed examination of potential tiered pricing models, 
                we aimed to assess the fairness and efficiency of the existing system. 
                Initial findings revealed a non-linear relationship between meter size and water charges, 
                with notable discrepancies across different usage tiers and property categories. 
                This research is essential for enhancing Chelseas utility management and exploring 
                opportunities for optimizing billing strategies to ensure fairness and promote sustainable water usage.</p>

            <h3>Current Liabilities and Current Assets in Domestic Companies with Bankruptcy Status</h3>
            <p>This project investigates the financial patterns in failed U.S. companies, 
                focusing on the relationship between current liabilities and current assets. 
                Using panel data from American public companies between 1999 and 2018, the study found that a $1000 
                increase in current liabilities is associated with a $471.47 increase in expected current assets. 
                The initial model explained 32% of the variation, but after incorporating control variables like EBITDA, 
                long-term debt, and net sales, the model's explanatory power increased to 60.3%. 
                This research offers valuable insights into the financial dynamics of failed 
                companies and highlights the importance of additional factors in understanding asset behavior.</p>
